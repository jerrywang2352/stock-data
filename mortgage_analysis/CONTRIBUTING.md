- Sign into Github.com with your personal GitHub username 
- Click on your profile picture on the top right and select profile 
- Click on the Fannie Mae organizations on the left side 
- Click on people  
- In the search bar, type your name 
- Change your organization visibility to public  

If Fannie Mae is not showing as an organization on your profile already, be sure to list Fannie Mae in the company field once you click “edit profile”. Also make sure your Fannie Mae email is tied to your Fannie Mae account.   

PLease note that Fannie Mae open source projects all have a the [FNMA Contrbuting License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/BrittanyIstenes/f73ffd0d7596f06e78486e232bcb88e6) embeded for all external contributions.
